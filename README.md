# ContentDisabler

Create a config for every item and equipment that allows hiding said item or equipment.

This is a last resort for disabling items and equipment, you should use the config from source mod if available.

Items and Equipment are removed from the logbook.

Prevents items and equipment from showing up anywhere that draws from the normal drop pool :

- Chests, Sacrifice, MultiShops, CommandMenus.

Probably does not prevent items from showing up by other means (untested) :

- HelperItems, FixedRewards, ItemTransformation, BossRewards

## Installation:

Requires Bepinex and HookGenPatcher.

Use r2modman or place inside of Risk of Rain 2/Bepinex/Plugins/

## Changelog:
